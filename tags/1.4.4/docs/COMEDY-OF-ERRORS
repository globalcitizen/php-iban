This file lists specific errors observed in the official IBAN specification.

In addition to the specific errors, there persist basic outstanding
matters that cause issue for implementers:
 - Non 1:1 mapping of records to countries (eg: French territories, etc.)
 - Mixing of free text and hard data in specification fields
 - Lack of validation of information in fields prior to publishing
 - Lack of synchronisation between TXT and PDF versions of the registry
