To get the latest ISO13616 IBAN registry, go to:
 https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/iban#topic-tabs-menu

TXT format:
 https://www.swift.com/node/11971

PDF format:
 https://www.swift.com/file/5996/download?token=lf3shUpn

Unfortunately, it has been noticed in 2011 that the official .txt file is
not an accurate representation of the PDF format specification, and lacks
some information. It is hoped that in future SWIFT will be more careful to
publish only correct standards information.

It has been noted in 2014 that this is still the case.
